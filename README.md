## Age Estimator

This assignment is done for Introduction to Machine Learning class.

You may find the instructions of this assignment in Assigment 2.pdf
I removed the theoritical part of my work before uploading.

In this assignment, it is asked to implement an age estimator KNN (and weighted KNN), using given FGNET dataset.
Eventually, I should have two models (one KNN and one WeightedKNN) that estimates people's ages using their photographs.
